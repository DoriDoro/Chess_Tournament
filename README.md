# Chess Tournament

## Description:
Project 4 of OpenClassrooms Path: Developer Python - Chess Tournament -- create a console based Chess Tournament 
program 

The application must be a stand-alone, offline program. The program must be written in Python and run from the console.
In other words, the execution of the program should look like this: **python main.py** . The program should run 
on Windows, Mac or Linux and have a requirements.txt file listing the dependencies needed to run the program.
We would like to contain a database of players in JSON files. 
The program should have a section dedicated to adding players and a tournament.
